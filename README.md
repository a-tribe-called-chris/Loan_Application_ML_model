# Loan_Application_ML_model

Takes loan applicant data and builds an ML model using sklearn, pandas, and pickle to predict if 
an applicant will be accepted or rejected.

Overall model performace is 82.22% which I deem as acceptable.

Inlcuded a small writeup on how RidgeRegression functions and a few thoughts on improvements for the model. 

included the data the model was built upon.
